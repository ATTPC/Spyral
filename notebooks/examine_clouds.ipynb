You do not need to have run Spyral to run this notebook, you simply must have created a valid Spyral input configuration. Plots of the individual traces point clouds in two and three dimensions can be made to check the status of the results. This is helpful for testing the parameters generated by the first phase. It actually runs a mini-version of phase 1. Note that the data generated here is NOT saved. This is only for testing."
