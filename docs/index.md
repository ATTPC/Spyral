# Spyral Analysis Framework

Spyral is an analysis framework for data from the Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC).

Spyral is written in pure Python, making it easy to read and modify for the varied types of AT-TPC data. Spyral works in incremental phases that allow the user to step through the analysis and monitor the progress, tweaking parameters to obtain the best possible outcome.
