# Spyral Analysis Framework

Spyral is an analysis framework for data from the Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC).

Spyral is written in pure Python, making it easy to read and modify for the varied types of AT-TPC data. However, Spyral doesn't sacrifice on speed thanks to the powerful [Numba](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) just-in-time compiler and the multiprocessing standard library. Spyral works in incremental phases that allow the user to step through the analysis and monitor the progress, tweaking parameters to obtain the best possible outcome.
