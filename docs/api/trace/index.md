# trace Module

This module contains the submodules defining the different signal types and analysis methods used in Spyral. In particular, there are two main varieties: signals from the AT-TPC pad plane in the GET DAQ system, and signals from auxilary detectors in the FRIBDAQ system. The submodules are:

- [get_event](get_event.md)
- [get_trace](get_trace.md)
- [frib_event](frib_event.md)
- [frib_trace](frib_trace.md)
- [peak](peak.md)
