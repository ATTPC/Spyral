# Getting Started with Spyral

## Python and Pip

Spyral requires a Python of version > 3.10 and < 3.13. Most operating systems do not have one of these installed, and you will need to install it yourself. The recommended (minimum) version is 3.11.

### Linux

To install on Linux (Debian flavor) use

```bash
sudo apt install python3.11
```

You will also to install the appropriate pip using

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### MacOS

Python can be easily installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). To install Python 3.11 use

```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

This will also install the appropriate pip.

### Windows

Windows is mostly a mess for this. You can download from the official [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) if you want and manual install. However, I recommend using Visual Studio Installer (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022)) to install everything. It will make sure your paths are set and not a huge mess. However, Visual Studio is quite heavy, so your mileage may vary.

### Using the right Python

In general when a newer version of Python is installed it is aliased as `python3`. Sometimes if multiple new versions are installed you may have to get more specific and use something like `python3.11`. You can always check by running the interpreter to see which version you are actively using.

## Installation

To download Spyral it is recommend to use `git`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turinath/Spyral.git
```

This will download the Spyral source code and install it to a directory named `Spyral`. To install all of the necessary dependencies it is recommended to create a virtual environment and use pip. To create a new virtual environment navigate to the Spyral directory and run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Note that on some operating systems you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`. Once your virtual environment is created, activate it by running

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The above example is for Linux/MacOS. Windows users will need to use the slightly different commands. More details on virtualenvs can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Once the virtualenv is active, use pip to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To make sure everything went ok you can then run

```bash
python main.py --help
```

from the top level of the repository. This should display the Spyral help message if everything went well.

### Why use virtual environments?

This allows us to keep all of the Spyral dependencies isolated from any other projects you have! Otherwise versions of libraries might clash and result in all kinds of nasty side effects.

### Do I need anything else?

The only other thing you'll need is some data to analyze!

### What are the Spyral dependencies?

These are the packages Spyral needs to run. Here we've listed the big dependencies

- [spyral-utils](https://github.com/gwm17/spyral-utils/) - This includes
    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
    - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/)
- [filterpy](https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Technically not required and not used, but...
- [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/)
- [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/)
- [numba](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [rocket-fft](https://pypi.org/project/rocket-fft/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

Without these amazing packages, Spyral wouldn't be anywhere near as useful. Thank you to all of these amazing projects!
