# Spyral Phases

The Spyral framework is broken into four distinct phases. In the following sections we'll break down each of these phases and describe in detail what exactly is happening under the hood.

Each phase should represent a single step in analysis, taking in some input and producing some output. This modular approach allows Spyral to be run in successive passes, and progress can be monitored on a phase-by-phase basis.
