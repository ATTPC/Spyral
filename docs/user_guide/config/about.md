# Configuration of Spyral

At the core of Spyral is the configuration specified in a JSON file. This configuration tells Spyral how to do everything from find data to setting analysis parameters to where it can write results. In general, configurations will need to be tweaked for almost every experiment in order to achieve the best results. In the following sections we'll go over each configuration parameter in detail and give some example of what a good default value might be and talk about the defaults given in the example `config.json` (where applicable).
